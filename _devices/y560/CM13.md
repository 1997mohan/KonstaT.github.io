Here's my build of CyanogenMod 13 for Huawei Y5 (Y560-L01/L02/L03/L23/U23). It is unofficial and unsupported by the CyanogenMod team. It's for **advanced users** only.

**How to install:**

1. boot into [TWRP recovery](/devices/y560/TWRP)
2. backup -> backup (create a nandroid backup of your current ROM)
3. wipe -> advanced wipe -> wipe /system
4. wipe -> factory reset
5. install cm-13.0-xxxxxxxx-KonstaKANG-y560.zip
6. (install L02/L03/L23/U23 patch if necessary - see FAQ below)
7. install open_gapps-arm-6.0-pico-xxxxxxxx.zip
8. reboot system
9. if/when recovery asks to install SuperSU - choose no

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options and performance settings, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced reboot*

Q: I have no root, why? What is that hashtag on my status bar?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Root access. Root management is now integrated as part of CM's Privacy Guard and you can manage per app permissions under Settings -> Privacy -> Privacy Guard. You'll have a persistent notification in the status bar when you're running an app that uses root permissions.*

Q: There's a notification about configuring sdcard on the first boot. Which option should I choose?  
*A: Selecting to use sdcard as 'internal storage' will format sdcard to EXT4 filesystem and encrypt it. This means you can't use your sdcard outside this ROM (CWM/TWRP recovery on this device, any other phone, tablet, computer with sdcard reader, etc)! Selecting to use sdcard as 'portable storage' (or ignoring the notification) and your sdcard continues to work like with previous Android versions.*

Q: I have dual-SIM variant (Y560-L02/L03/L23). What do I need to do?  
*A: Install patch from [this post](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=65104843&postcount=49).*

Q: I have Huawei Y5 Y560-U23\. What do I need to do?  
*A: Install patch from [this post](http://www.modaco.com/forums/topic/376952-devrom65-cyanogenmod-13-android-601-for-huawei-y5/?do=findComment&comment=2273846).*
