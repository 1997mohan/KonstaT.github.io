**How to install:**

1. Follow the official Raspberry Pi instructions for writing the image to the SD card ([Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md), [Mac](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md), [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)).

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced restart*

Q: I have no root, why? What is that hashtag on my status bar?  
*A: You need enable root access under Settings -> Developer options -> Root access. Root management is now integrated as part of LineageOS' Privacy Guard and you can manage per app permissions under Settings -> Developer options -> Manage root access. You'll have a persistent notification in the status bar when you're running an app that uses root permissions.*

Q: I have official 7" LCD display and touchscreen. What should I do?  
*A: Execute following commands in 'adb shell'/serial console/terminal and reboot your device:*

```
su
/system/bin/rpi3-display.sh
```

*If you have official 7" LCD display version 1.0 that doesn't support changing backlight brightness (vs. newer v1.1 that does) and your device boots with display backlight off you need to remove lights HAL and reboot your device:*

```
su
mount -o rw,remount /system
rm /system/lib/hw/lights.rpi3.so
```

Q: Settings -> Storage shows xx GB used by system. There's unallocated space on my scard. What should I do?  
*A: This is a 4 GB image, remaining space on your sdcard will remain unallocated. Settings app shows unallocated space as used by system which in reality it is not. You can use e.g. GParted and extend /data partition (/dev/block/mmcblk0p3) to cover the unallocated space.*
