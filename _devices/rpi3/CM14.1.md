**How to install:**

1. Follow the official Raspberry Pi instructions for writing the image to the SD card ([Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md), [Mac](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md), [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)).

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced restart*

Q: I have no root, why? What is that hashtag on my status bar?  
*A: You need enable root access under Settings -> Developer options -> Root access. Root management is now integrated as part of LineageOS' Privacy Guard and you can manage per app permissions under Settings -> Developer options -> Manage root access. You'll have a persistent notification in the status bar when you're running an app that uses root permissions.*

Q: I have official 7" LCD display and touchscreen. What should I do?  
*A: Execute following commands in 'adb shell'/serial console/terminal and reboot your device:*

```
su
/system/bin/rpi3-display.sh
```

Q: Settings -> Storage shows xx GB used by system. There's unallocated space on my scard. What should I do?  
*A: This is a 4 GB image, remaining space on your sdcard will remain unallocated. Settings app shows unallocated space as used by system which in reality it is not. You can use e.g. GParted and extend /data partition (/dev/block/mmcblk0p3) to cover the unallocated space.*
