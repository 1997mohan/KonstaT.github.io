**How to install:**

1. Follow the official Raspberry Pi instructions for writing the image to the SD card ([Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md), [Mac](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md), [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)).

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options and performance settings, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced restart*

Q: I have no root, why? What is that hashtag on my status bar?  
*A: You need enable root access under Settings -> Developer options -> Root access. Root management is now integrated as part of LineageOS' Privacy Guard and you can manage per app permissions under Settings -> Developer options -> Manage root access. You'll have a persistent notification in the status bar when you're running an app that uses root permissions.*
